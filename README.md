> _`libft` is the inaugural project in the School 42 common core curriculum, aimed at developing a custom C library. <br>
> The objective is to implement a range of general-purpose functions that are commonly available in standard libraries, as well as additional functions designed by the developer. <br>
This project focuses on creating a comprehensive library of utilities that will be fundamental for various programming tasks. It serves as a foundational exercise in C programming, providing essential functions to support and enhance future projects.._
