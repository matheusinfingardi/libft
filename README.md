## üìç **Introduction**

The objective is to implement a range of general-purpose functions that are commonly available in standard libraries, as well as additional functions designed by the developer. <br> <br>
This project focuses on creating a comprehensive library of utilities that will be fundamental for various programming tasks. It serves as a foundational exercise in C programming, providing essential functions to support future projects.

### Advice üìù

- **Norminette**: Ensure that all code adheres to the coding standards enforced by Norminette. This includes formatting, function length, variable naming, and overall code style. Failure to comply with these standards will result in code rejection.
  
- **Memory Leaks**: Verify that the project does not produce memory leaks. Use tools such as Valgrind to check for any memory allocation issues and ensure that all dynamically allocated memory is properly freed.

- **Segmentation Faults**: Thoroughly test the code to prevent segmentation faults. Make sure all pointers are properly initialized and that memory accesses are within valid bounds.

- **Flags Used**: Utilize appropriate compiler flags for debugging and optimization. For example, use `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` to enable all warnings and treat them as errors. Ensure that the Makefile includes commands to compile with these flags to maintain code quality.

- **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing for all functions to verify correctness and robustness. Ensure that tests cover various edge cases and typical usage scenarios.
